We don't distribute docs as part of the source build so we're not obliged to report the JS we include
or generate a special LICENSE file as brooklyn-dist/dist/licensing does for the distributed projects.

(This project just gets the usual brooklyn license.)

However we might consider recording the licenses used in the docs.  So we note
that third-party software bundled by the docs include:

* bloodhound (aka typeahead)
* glossarizer

And other things used by brooklyn, in style/{deps,js}.
